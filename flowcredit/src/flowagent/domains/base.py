"""Domain modules: the pluggable side of the kernel.

A module owns everything a particular line of work needs and nothing else:

* how to build its world (fixtures, data sources, synthetic or real),
* its toolset (the shared workspace tools are composed on top by the caller),
* its planner (the blueprint a deterministic provider follows),
* its verifier (independent recomputation — the only path to "succeeded"),
* which tools are consequential enough to pause for a human.

The kernel never imports a module. Adding a line of work means adding a module
and registering it; it does not mean teaching the runtime a new noun.

    #: very steps the plan requires (observed on a real run, not in theory).
