"""Finance research: the deterministic reference workload module.

The general module is the product's default entry; this one stays registered
because it gives the reliability scenarios a world whose answer can be
independently recomputed. The seven finance tools, the blueprint planner and
the margin recomputation all live here. The shared workspace tools (ingestion,
artifacts, connectors) are composed by the caller, not owned by this module.
