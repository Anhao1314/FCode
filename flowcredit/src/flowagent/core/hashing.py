"""Canonical JSON encoding and SHA-256 hashing.

Every hash in this runtime is computed over *canonical* JSON, never over
``repr`` or ``str`` of a Python object. Canonical means:

* object keys sorted by Unicode code point,
* no insignificant whitespace (``separators=(",", ":")``),
* non-ASCII characters kept as-is and encoded as UTF-8,
* ``None``/``True``/``False`` rendered as ``null``/``true``/``false``.

Two processes that agree on the data therefore agree on the bytes, which is
what makes an append-only hash chain verifiable after a crash or on another
machine. ``float`` is deliberately rejected: money and token counts are
integers, and float formatting is the usual way a "reproducible" hash stops
being reproducible.
