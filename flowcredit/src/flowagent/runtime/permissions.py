"""The host gate: the only place that decides whether a proposal may run.

A model proposal is a *request*, never an instruction. This module turns that
request into a decision with a stable code, so the trace can show a denial and
the reason for it. Three independent scopes must all agree:

1. the tool must be registered at all,
2. the task must list it in ``allowed_tools``,
3. the current grant must list it too.

Checking three times looks redundant until you remember that the grant is
re-read from the host on every round: a permission revoked mid-task must stop
the very next call, which is impossible if only the task body is consulted.
