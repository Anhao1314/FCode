"""A deterministic offline model that follows the plan it is given.

This is not a stand-in for a language model; it is a stand-in for *the shape of a
model's output*. Two properties matter and are both load-bearing:

**It reads only the context.** Observations, the plan, the tool catalogue. It
never looks at the world directly. If the next action can be decided from the
context alone, then the context design is sufficient, and "would a real model do
better" becomes an empirical question rather than a structural one.

**It does not decide the sequence.** Earlier versions hardcoded the nine steps.
Now the plan decides what is left, and the policy only picks the first open todo.
That is the difference between a workflow and an agent: the order lives in a
revisable object, not in a policy function.

Policies exist so the reliability scenarios can provoke a specific failure without
touching the runtime.
